* Here is the link to the windows build and video demo for this lesson: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CaY51J5gtHGekQIguPQqZ29SJAI9j_8M?usp=sharing)


* I used the default third person demo as the starting point.
* Added a main menu with widgets (UI). 
* Player can hit 'v' to add score.
* Player can hit 'tab' to view score.
* Added an automatic save game feature. Users can quit the game, and the previous score will be kept the same when they launch the game the second time. 
* Users can change their display name on the scoreboard.
