# Lesson05 - Unreal Engine Animations

* Here is the link to the windows build and video demo for this lesson: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vg9CFGZXYX__Mwq5OD6P_7wDMA438pg1?usp=sharing)

## Asset packs used:
* Infinity Blade: Effects
* Starter Animation Pack
* FPS Weapon Bundle

## Project info
* I used the default third person demo as the starting point.
* I used the starter animation pack's animation to create aim offsets, blend spaces, and anim montages.
* Player can hold 'alt' to freelook (Win version, for Android, there is a touch interface).
* Player can hit 'v' to perform a rifle melee (Win version, for Android, there is a touch interface).
* Added SFX and bullets for the gun.  
* I used slots to make animations smoother (e.g. the shooting animations and melee animations are blended with player movements).
